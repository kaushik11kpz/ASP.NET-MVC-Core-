WebAPI
-WebAPI is MVC Controller which helps us to expose data and services over HTTP.
-WebAPI controller delivers data and services easily by using HTTP REST services.
-Thus these data and services exposed by WebAPI can be consumed everywhere.
-WebAPI helps to create Restful Service.

Explain REST and architectural contrainsts of REST
-REST-Representational State Transfer.
-REST is an architectural style/principle where client and server talk in terms of representations and states.
-Thus, client and server are decoupled.
-Representation such as JSON/XML/CSV and state is a feature of data.
-This state and representation of data can be implemented using HTTP and HTTP can be implemented using Web API.
-Priciple of Rest are
1. Client Server.
2. Statelessness.
3. Unique URI.
4. Manipluation happens through representation.

-We cannot expose our data, services through TCP/IP.
-As TCP/IP is stateful and statelessness is requirement of Rest API.

How WebAPI is different from MVC Controller
-MVC Controller can return a Razore views but WebAPI cannot.
-Content Negotiations-depending on the client data sent in header Web API reacts as it is following HTTP protocol.
-WebAPI inherits from ControllerBase while normal MVC Controller inherits from Controller.

WCF vs WebAPI
-XML is mandatory in WCF.
-Web API can use JSON,XML,etc.

How to return status codes and data through WebAPI
-return StatusCode(StatusCodes.Status200ok,"Test"); or return OK("Test")
 with return type IActionResult

500-Internal server error
